# Welcome

This is my first post on this blog. I'm starting this project to document my learning journey through college, focusing on mathematics, computer science, and interesting problems I encounter.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing short, focused posts and quick animations about:

- **Algorithms** - analysis and implementation of interesting algorithms
- **Mathematics** - proofs, problems, and elegant solutions
- **Puzzles** - chess tactics, logic puzzles, and brain teasers
- **Visualizations** - using animations to explain complex concepts in simple ways

## Why Short Content?

I believe in quality over quantity. Each post will focus on one concept or problem, explained clearly with visuals when helpful. No fluff, just the core ideas. Feel free to email me at mkhanal@rollins.edu if you would like anything covered.
